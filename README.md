## 🚀 What Is This?

Born from a Reddit thread and months of iteration, **The Agency** is a collection of meticulously crafted AI agent personalities. Each agent is:

- **🎯 Specialized**: Deep expertise in their domain (not generic prompt templates)
- **🧠 Personality-Driven**: Unique voice, communication style, and approach
- **📋 Deliverable-Focused**: Real code, processes, and measurable outcomes
- **✅ Production-Ready**: Battle-tested workflows and success metrics

**Think of it as**: Assembling your dream team, except they're AI specialists who never sleep, never complain, and always deliver.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Option 1: Use with Claude Code (Recommended)

```bash
# Copy agents to your Claude Code directory
cp -r agency-agents/* ~/.claude/agents/

# Now activate any agent in your Claude Code sessions:
# "Hey Claude, activate Frontend Developer mode and help me build a React component"
```

### Option 2: Use as Reference

Each agent file contains:
- Identity & personality traits
- Core mission & workflows
- Technical deliverables with code examples
- Success metrics & communication style

Browse the agents below and copy/adapt the ones you need!

### Option 3: Use with Other Tools (Cursor, Aider, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Kimi Code)

```bash
# Step 1 -- generate integration files for all supported tools
./scripts/convert.sh

# Step 2 -- install interactively (auto-detects what you have installed)
./scripts/install.sh

# Or target a specific tool directly
./scripts/install.sh --tool cursor
./scripts/install.sh --tool copilot
./scripts/install.sh --tool aider
./scripts/install.sh --tool windsurf
./scripts/install.sh --tool kimi
```

## 🔌 Multi-Tool Integrations

The Agency works natively with Claude Code, and ships conversion + install scripts so you can use the same agents across every major agentic coding tool.

### Supported Tools

- **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** — native `.md` agents, no conversion needed → `~/.claude/agents/`
- **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/copilot)** — native `.md` agents, no conversion needed → `~/.github/agents/` + `~/.copilot/agents/`
- **[Antigravity](https://github.com/google-gemini/antigravity)** — `SKILL.md` per agent → `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/`
- **[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)** — extension + `SKILL.md` files → `~/.gemini/extensions/agency-agents/`
- **[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)** — `.md` agent files → `.opencode/agents/`
- **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh)** — `.mdc` rule files → `.cursor/rules/`

### ⚡ Quick Install

**Step 1 -- Generate integration files:**
```bash
./scripts/convert.sh
# Faster (parallel, output order may vary): ./scripts/convert.sh --parallel
```

**Step 2 -- Install (interactive, auto-detects your tools):**
```bash
./scripts/install.sh
# Faster (parallel, output order may vary): ./scripts/install.sh --no-interactive --parallel
```

The installer scans your system for installed tools, shows a checkbox UI, and lets you pick exactly what to install:

```
  +------------------------------------------------+
  |   The Agency -- Tool Installer                 |
  +------------------------------------------------+

  System scan: [*] = detected on this machine

  [x]  1)  [*]  Claude Code     (claude.ai/code)
  [x]  2)  [*]  Copilot         (~/.github + ~/.copilot)
  [x]  3)  [*]  Antigravity     (~/.gemini/antigravity)
  [ ]  4)  [ ]  Gemini CLI      (gemini extension)
  [ ]  5)  [ ]  OpenCode        (opencode.ai)
  [ ]  6)  [ ]  OpenClaw        (~/.openclaw)
  [x]  7)  [*]  Cursor          (.cursor/rules)
  [ ]  8)  [ ]  Aider           (CONVENTIONS.md)
  [ ]  9)  [ ]  Windsurf        (.windsurfrules)
  [ ] 10)  [ ]  Qwen Code       (~/.qwen/agents)
  [ ] 11)  [ ]  Kimi Code       (~/.config/kimi/agents)

  [1-11] toggle   [a] all   [n] none   [d] detected
  [Enter] install   [q] quit
```

**Or install a specific tool directly:**
```bash
./scripts/install.sh --tool cursor
./scripts/install.sh --tool opencode
./scripts/install.sh --tool openclaw
./scripts/install.sh --tool antigravity
```

**Non-interactive (CI/scripts):**
```bash
./scripts/install.sh --no-interactive --tool all
```

**Faster runs (parallel)** — On multi-core machines, use `--parallel` so each tool is processed in parallel. Output order across tools is non-deterministic. Works with both interactive and non-interactive install: e.g. `./scripts/install.sh --interactive --parallel` (pick tools, then install in parallel) or `./scripts/install.sh --no-interactive --parallel`. Job count defaults to `nproc` (Linux), `sysctl -n hw.ncpu` (macOS), or 4; override with `--jobs N`.

```bash
./scripts/convert.sh --parallel                    # convert all tools in parallel
./scripts/convert.sh --parallel --jobs 8           # cap parallel jobs
./scripts/install.sh --no-interactive --parallel   # install all detected tools in parallel
./scripts/install.sh --interactive --parallel      # pick tools, then install in parallel
./scripts/install.sh --no-interactive --parallel --jobs 4
```
